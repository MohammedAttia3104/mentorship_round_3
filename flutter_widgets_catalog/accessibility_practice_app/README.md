## 📱 Accessibility Scanner App

To test accessibility, use the [Accessibility Scanner](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.accessibility.auditor) app (Android).  
It helps identify accessibility issues in your app, such as missing labels, low contrast, and touch target size.

## 🕵️‍♀️ Accessibility Features

- Semantic labels for buttons, images, and interactive elements.
- Descriptive hints and values for screen readers.
- Color contrast and color name semantics for color pickers.
- Dynamic labels based on content (e.g., image descriptions).
- Keyboard navigation and focus management.

## ✅ Ways to Apply Accessibility

- Use the `Semantics` widget to provide labels, hints, and roles.
- Add descriptions to images using `Semantics(label: ...)`.
- Ensure sufficient color contrast and provide color names.
- Make all interactive elements accessible via keyboard and screen readers.
- Test with accessibility tools and real users.
