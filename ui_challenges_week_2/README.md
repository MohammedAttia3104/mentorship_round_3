# UI Challenge Week 2

This repository contains solutions to the UI challenges presented in Week 2 of the Mentor. Each challenge is implemented
in a separate folder, with clear instructions and code comments to help you understand the implementation.



## Challenges

1. **Challenge : Interactive Dismissible Lists**
    - Create a task management widget using `Dismissible` combined with `ReorderableListView`. Users should be able to
      swipe to delete tasks and drag to reorder them. Include confirmation dialogs and undo functionality.
    - Requirements:
        - Use `Dismissible` for swipe-to-delete functionality
        - Use `ReorderableListView` for drag-to-reorder
        - Show confirmation dialog before deletion
        - Provide undo functionality using `SnackBar`
        - Include at least 3 sample tasks


2. **Challenge : Interactive Physics Widget**
    - Use `Draggable` and `DragTarget` widgets to create a mini physics simulation where users can drag colored balls
      into matching colored containers.
    - Requirements:
        - Create draggable colored balls (at least 3 different colors)
        - Create matching colored drop targets/containers
        - Provide visual feedback during dragging
        - Show success state when correct matches are made
        - Handle both correct and incorrect drops
     

3. **Challenge : Advanced Animation Chain**
    - Create a widget that uses `AnimationController` with multiple `Tween` animations to create a loading sequence with
      3 dots that scale and fade in sequence.
    - Requirements:
        - Use `AnimationController` with proper disposal
        - Create sequential animations for 3 dots
        - Include both scale and opacity animations
        - Loop the animation continuously
        - Use proper curves for smooth animation
